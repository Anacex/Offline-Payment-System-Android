   # Documentation index (condensed)

   This index points to the consolidated documentation files. Older, redundant docs have been replaced by these unified references.

   ## Recommended starting points

   - `README.md` — Project overview and quick start
   - `TESTING.md` — Consolidated testing guide and the test DB strategy used locally (unit tests)
   - `CI_AND_SECRETS.md` — CI and GitHub Secrets consolidated guide
   - `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` — Detailed production deployment guide

   ## Additional references (kept)

   - `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` — Short deployment checklist and quick verification steps
   - `THREAT_MODEL.md` — Security / threat model analysis

   If you need further consolidation (archive or delete other legacy docs), tell me which topics you'd like merged and I will move leftover files into an `archive_docs/` folder or remove them entirely.
**Recommended First Read:** `README.md` or `TESTING.md` ⭐

These files provide a concise project overview and the consolidated testing guide (unit tests and local test DB strategy).
